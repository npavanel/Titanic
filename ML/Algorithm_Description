I use a five feature regularized logistic regression classification algorithm to determine the fitting parameters for the model. 
I perform feature engineering that creates a dual term, cubic polynomial composed of all pairs of the featues from degree 0 to 3. 

Feature engineering can be found in the MapFeature file.
The algorithm is 

I believe that my algorithm could be improved with more complex feature engineering - creating tri-term polynomial would be the next step.
