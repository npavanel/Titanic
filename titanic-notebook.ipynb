Determined the data type of all features and the amount of null values in each feature.\n3. Changed the sex feature from string data types to numerical data type so that they may be used in an algorithm.\n4. Excised all rows that contined NaN values from the training set - a total of 177 / 891 of Age data or 20% of the training data. (This may be changed later)\n5. Saved the features that I plan on using from a .csv file to a .txt file to run with Octave \n6. Analyed the testing data, and found that 20% of testing Ages were null. 20% is too high to throw out the window, so I resolved to finding a way to input random ages to the null locations.\n7. Determined that a fifth order polynomial fits the training Age distribution well, and constructed a distribution of values following such a polynomial to draw from to input into null locations.\n8. Modified an Octave regularized polynomial logistic regression algorithm to find the optimal parameters for a model that will predict the survivability of a new Titanic passenger based on the features that I have chosen.\n9. Filled in null ages values in the test data set from the fifth order function that I have created with random.choice(distribution). The function needs to be made into either a probability distribution, or into an actul distribution. Currently it is just a linear set of values. INSTEAD PULL FROM AGES\n10.
